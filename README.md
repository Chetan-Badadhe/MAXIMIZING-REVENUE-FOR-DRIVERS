**Problem Statement:**
 
In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, making the most of revenue is essential for long-term success and driver happiness. 
Our goal is to use data-driven insights to maximise revenue streams for taxi drivers in order to meet this need. Our research aims to determine whether payment methods have an impact on fare pricing by focusing on the relationship between payment type and fare amount..

**Data Overview:**

For this analysis, we utilized the comprehensive dataset of NYC Taxi Trip records, used data cleaning and feature engineering procedures to concentrate solely on the relevant columns essential for our investigation.

**Relevant columns used for this reseach:**

1. passenger_count (1 to 5)
2. payment_type (card or cash)
3. fare_amount
4. trip_distance (miles)
5. duration (minutes)

**Journey Insights**

1. Customers paying with cards tend to have a slightly higher average trip distance and fare amount compared to those paying with cash.
2. Indicates that customers prefers to pay more with cards when they have high fare amount and long trip distance.

**Preference of Payment Types**

1. The proportion of customers paying with cards is significantly higher than those paying with cash, with card payments accounting for 67.5% of all transactions compared to cash payments at 32.5%.
2. This indicates a strong preference among customers for using card payments over cash, potentially due to convenience, security, or incentives offered for card transactions.

**Passenger Count Analysis**

1. Among card payments, rides with a single passenger (passenger_count = 1) comprise the largest proportion, constituting 40.08% of all card transactions.
2. Similarly, cash payments are predominantly associated with single-passenger rides, making up 20.04% of all cash transactions.
3. There is a noticeable decrease in the percentage of transactions as the passenger count increases, suggesting that larger groups are less likely to use taxis or may opt for alternative payment methods.
4. These insights emphasize the importance of considering both payment method and passenger count when analyzing transaction data, as they provide valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.

#**Hypothesis Testing**

**Null hypothesis**: There is no difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash.

**Alternative hypothesis:** There is a difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash
